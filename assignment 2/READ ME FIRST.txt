- To run the script for the **first** time:
1. Open the terminal and change directory to Debug Folder of your project
2. Type: 
	chmod +x script.sh
3. Type:
	./script.sh

- To run the script again Type this line only:
	./script.sh

- The Script only works on Linux OS.
- Make sure that the content of the .zip file is extracted to your DEBUG folder.
(i.e. the four files inside the .zip folder should be located beside your project in Debug folder) 
- It's very possible that the script isn't 100% correct so please check "Test Results" file after every test.
